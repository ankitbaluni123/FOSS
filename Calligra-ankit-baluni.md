#### **Project Proposal :**

##### **Introduction :**

**Calligra Suite** is a graphic art and office suite developed by KDE for 22 years. .It contains applications for word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, databases, vector graphics, and digital painting.Currently, the web-page of Calligra looks very dated and is using old screenshots from the KDE4 era.

As the website has not been revised for a long time, this creates a problem for users.

For Example : On clicking on **Braindump** we get **Not Found** error and kde userbase says that is now **unmaintained**, so we could just archive them so that the **users don't get confused.**

Note from Carl: don't delete information, make it clear that this is not maintained anymore

#### **Project Goal and Implementations:**

If the website looks **remotely un-appealing to the user, it's highly unlikely that the user will remain optimistic and not judge the rest of the content** the website has to offer. In other words, they will probably move onward to other websites . As Calligra site is outdated and it is quite bad experience to use in other devices. 

If we are browsing website in smartphone ,then it is quite difficult to see the drop-down list , we could change that by changing it to a responsive site.

As screenshots really help users to better understand about the the product. As the screenshots taken are out-dated , so we can change them. (**Snagit** tool can be used for the respective purpose)

As you have told ,we could use design of kontact as its quite a responsive site and it works fine in all platform we use it as a template and change the screenshots . We could add more screenshots so the users could get get easy understanding of products in Calligra suite. It will make calligra site appealing and make it easy for users 

As the image of screenshots take quite a time to load , we could use image optimization so that images can load faster .

#### **Schedule / Timeline :**

**6th of January 2020-8th of January 2020:**

After the project are announced till SoK work period begins ,we could have better experience of calligra products . That will help to understand what snapshot will hep the user to understand the product easily.

**8th of January 2020-15th of January 2020:**

We can take screenshots required and if required do image optimization to reduce its size (not reducing its quality by great margin).

**15th of January 2020-22nd of January 2020:**

We can prepare the write-up for different product. We could prepare new write-up for Words , Sheets , Kexi ,Stage etc. showing the changes that had incorporated in these product since the last time site was updated.

 **22nd of January 2020-17th of February 2020 :**

Using the data collected till now and using the html, css code (for template) we update the site ,making it better looking consisting of new screenshots and write-ups  that we had taken before .

#### **Coding skills :**

**Platform:** Lenovo Ideapad - Core i5 Processor, 8 GB RAM

**Operating System:** Windows 10 & Ubuntu 16.04

**Shell:** Terminal(Linux)

**Text Editor:** Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text

I have been a both a windows user as well as a Linux user in the past and quite comfortable in both. I have been a programming enthusiast right from the start of my college time and have been in web-development for about 2-3 years now.

**Web-Development** is something in which I see specializing myself more in upcoming years. **Competitive Programming** is also another field of interest for me.

 

###### **Coding Experience** (lines of code , approx.)

**HTML**- 10,000++

**CSS** – 10,00 ++

**PHP** – 10,000++

**JavaScript** – 3,000 ++

I also have good knowledge of  **C++17 , PYTHON 3.0  and  MYSQL** .

Having participated in **inter & intra web-development coding events** i am extremely comfortable in HTML, CSS,Java Script and PHP and can understand any code-base with the above mentioned languages. Also, I am proficient in Git. I have already participated in many open source events such as **KWoC** (Kharagpur Winter of Code) and many other college projects related to developing and maintaining websites for club-activity purposes. 

#### **Commitment :**

I have my semester break from **Dec 20 - Feb 15** (winter break) , which falls in the coding period during which I  will be able to work **10-12 hours per day** except for the last week. My college will open from Feb 15, after which I will be able to spend around 4-5 hours/day . Having successfully participated in the similar events in KWoC before, I am confident that I will be able to manage my time efficiently and devote as much time as required to complete the project.

#### **Other Goals**

* **Community Bonding:** I personally feel that the identity of any organization is also judged by the collaboration between the people working on it, and thereby I too will invest time on helping others, possibly provide possible solutions and hopefully create strong and healthy relationship between all the members of the KDE Community.
* **Blogging:** This will be hopefully one of the best parts of my SoK Journey, reaching out to the world and sharing my experience with them and even the members of the community. I would like to make up a weekly write-up of the work done and targets achieved. I will write a blog, post SoK after wrapping everything documenting all the changes made and the experience and would love to host it on my personal blog.

#### **Other SoK Projects :**

I’m not trying in any other projects.
