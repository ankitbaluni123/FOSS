**Calligra Suite** is a graphic art and office suite developed by KDE for 22 years. .It contains applications for word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, databases, vector graphics, and digital painting.Currently, the web-page of Calligra looks very dated and is using old screenshots from the KDE4 era.

As the website has not been revised for a long time, this creates a problem for users.

For Example : On clicking on **Braindump** we get **Not Found** error and kde userbase says that is now **unmaintained**, so we could just archive them so that the **users don't get confused.**

Note from Carl: don't delete information, make it clear that this is not maintained anymore.
